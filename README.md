# Bash_Projects
Different bash projects that I have made and test things with.

**USE AT OWN RISK**  
Many of these are just test projects and may only work of my devices(if I still have stuff hardcoded in there) or may break something. Many either a work in progress or just unfinished.

* [Gits](https://github.com/jb-williams/Bash_Projects/tree/main/Gits)   - A series of scripts messing with ways of keeping repos updated.
* [clipboard](https://github.com/jb-williams/Bash_Projects/tree/main/clipboard) - Scripting a way to easily interact with clipboard from terminal.
* [maintain](https://github.com/jb-williams/Bash_Projects/tree/main/maintain)   - Series of scripts dealing with maintenence.
* [mountxf](https://github.com/jb-williams/Bash_Projects/tree/main/mountxf) - Easy way of mounted partitions(usb) from the terminal using `udiski2`.
* [bookmark](https://github.com/jb-williams/Bash_Projects/blob/main/bookmarks) - Uses a `bookmark.md` full of urls in a terminal menu to open that site in a specified(hardcoded) browser.
* [edot](https://github.com/jb-williams/Bash_Projects/blob/main/edot)   - Creates a terminal menu of specific configuration files I edit regularly.

* [startup.sh](https://github.com/jb-williams/Bash_Projects/blob/main/startup.sh)   - just to pull up a terminal and passmanager when I need/want them.
